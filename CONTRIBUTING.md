# Contributing to C++ YOLO Object Detector

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the C++ YOLO Object Detector.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.11+
- OpenCV 4.1+
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amr-f-ramadan/cpp-yolo-object-detector.git
cd cpp-yolo-object-detector
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Code Standards

### C++ Style Guidelines
- Follow modern C++17 practices
- Use RAII for resource management
- Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers
- Use const-correctness throughout
- Follow the Rule of 5 for classes with custom destructors

### Code Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex algorithms

### Memory Management
- Always use smart pointers for dynamic allocation
- Implement proper move semantics where applicable
- Follow RAII patterns for resource cleanup
- Use const references for read-only parameters

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run the test suite before submitting:
```bash
cd build
./objectdetector --input=../data/people.jpg --conf=0.5
./objectdetector --input=../data/cars.jpg --conf=0.7
```

### Docker Testing
```bash
docker-compose up yolo-detector-batch
```

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**
